This code is an implementation of the dining philosophers problem, where several philosophers are simulated to sit at a table to eat. Each philosopher has a fork on the left and one on the right of his plate, and in order to eat he must take both forks. If all the philosophers take the forks to their left, mutual waiting situations can be generated, and therefore a deadlock.

The implementation solves this problem by using two variants of "philosophers": those who take the left fork first, and those who take the right fork first. In this way, the philosophers can take the forks simultaneously without entering a deadlock.

The program creates a thread for each philosopher, and each thread runs in parallel. The thread checks if the philosopher has been without food for too long and has consumed the specified number of meals. If either of these conditions is met, the thread terminates its execution and memory is freed.

The check_starvation function is in charge of checking if any philosopher has been without food for too long, and if so, it stops the execution of all philosophers and ends the program. In addition, it checks if all the philosophers have eaten the specified number of times, in which case it also stops execution and ends the program.

The parse_data function is responsible for reading the program arguments and storing them in a data structure. The check_args function verifies that the arguments are valid.

The philo_left_handed function is the implementation of a philo that grabs the left fork first. The philo_right_handed function is the implementation of a philo that takes the right fork first. Both functions implement the life cycle of the philosopher, which consists of taking the forks, eating, sleeping and thinking.

Functions that perform screen printing use a printf_mutex function that uses a mutex to prevent multiple functions from trying to print at the same time and producing garbled or incorrect screen output.
